Logic for projectiles

- Spawner Script (Check Game Mech final for code reference) on key press

- On collision with hazard (or something destructible), 
destroy Projectile and whatever it collided with.

- Call "Earned_Points" function with destroyed object's point value


Projectile 

- Spawn at Dabba's position

- Will just need fixed forward movement after being fired

- Attach behavior script to itself (for movement, object collision, etc)

- Need to be able to access obstacle's point value.
